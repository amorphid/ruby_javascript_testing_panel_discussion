## Needed:  Ruby/JS "experts"/chatty-types for panel discuss on testing

Hey there SFRuby!

I'm organizing a panel discussion on Ruby/JS testing w/ an emphasis on intermediate level topics.  Personally I'd like to know more about mocks & stubs.

# The following is needed:

1)  Panelist Volunteers:  Willing to chat about testing in front of an audience?  No prep work needed.  Just show up.  [Volunteer via pull request](http://www.yahoo.com).
2)  Talking points:  What's the one thing you'd really like to know about Ruby/JS testing?  [Propose talking point or edit list via pull request](http://www.google.com).

Here's the format:
* 30 min schoozing.
* 45 min pre-screened questions asked by me (or someone better looking (the bar is low))
* 45 min open Q&A

I'll secure a time/date/location convenient to panelists and then create/promote the event.

-Michael
