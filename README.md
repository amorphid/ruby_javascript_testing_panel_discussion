# Needed:  Ruby/JS "experts"/chatty-types for panel discuss on testing

Hey there SFRuby!

I'm organizing a panel discussion on Ruby/JS testing w/ an emphasis on intermediate level topics.  Personally I'd like to know more about mocks & stubs.

## The following is needed:
* **Panelist Volunteers:**  Willing to chat about testing in front of an audience?  [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/amorphid/ruby_javascript_testing_panel_discussion/blob/master/volunteer_panelists.md).
* **Questions:**  What's the one thing you'd really like to know about Ruby/JS testing?  [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/amorphid/ruby_javascript_testing_panel_discussion/blob/master/questions.md).

## Here's the format:
* 30 min schoozing.
* 45 min pre-screened questions asked by me (or someone better looking (the bar is low))
* 45 min open Q&A

## Next steps:

I'll secure a time/date/location convenient to panelists and then create/promote the event.
